# FeatureSelection
A machine learning feature selection script showing two ways of feature selecting and displaying the results of each.

Data:
Data is taken from UC Irvine's public machine learning database, this is their heart disease dataset. 

Tools:
The code is largely scikit-learn and logistic regression is used for the main machine learning portion of the code. Additionally, matplotlib is used for the final displays of the validity of the machine learning. 

Feature Selection:
Three varieties of feature selection are used: 
1. No feature selection - baseline
2. Selecting features based on the best attribute scores produced (specificity, accuracy etc)
3. Feature selection based on random forest
